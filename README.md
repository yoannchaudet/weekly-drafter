# Weekly Drafter

Hello my name is ðŸ¤– **Weekly Drafter** and I am an Action. My mission is to help drafting weekly updates in the form of PRs. These weekly updates can then be posted as discussions with the help of an integration like the amazing [Announcement Drafter](https://github.com/philip-gai/announcement-drafter).

## Configuration

I need two kind of configuration.

### Files

Configuration files are expected to live in a host repository (i.e. where this Action is being invoked from).

The files should live in `.github/weekly-drafter/` and be named:

- `config.toml` The main configuration file ([example](samples/config.toml))
- `weekly.template.liquid` The template file for the weekly's content ([example](samples/weekly.template.liquid))

## Commands

I can do a few things.

### Create

- Create a pull request with a weekly update using a template
- Ping individual people (writers) that should help draft the update
- Send a Slack notification (optional)

### Remind
